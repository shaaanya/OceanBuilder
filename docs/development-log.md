## 2026-10-30: first vertical slice

Done (all verified by running it):

- Repo, Go module `github.com/ocean-compiler/ocean`, CLI: `build`, `validate`, `preview`, `export`, `sources list`, `world init`, `cache stats|clean`, `version`.
- Real data: GMRT topo + topo-mask and OSM coastline for Falmouth (16 tiles) and Mindelo (20 tiles).
- Normalisation onto a UTM vertex grid, shared-edge tiles, depth classes, shore masks, manifest with provenance, attribution file.
- Validator: missing/corrupt tiles (hash), ids, bounds, edge cracks, nodata, 60° slope steps, survey-backed fraction, upsampling, coastline offset, provenance/licence.
- Unity 6000.4.0f1: batchmode import of Falmouth produced 16 linked terrains and a saved scene (`OCEAN_IMPORT_OK`).
- Tests (offline, real-data fixtures): config, bilinear/nodata, shoreline search, UTM zones, projection scale, OSM conversion, build + validate, determinism, tamper detection, crack detection, nodata reporting. Benchmarks for build and validate.

Findings:

- GMRT `topo-mask` is NaN, not a byte mask (my first reading of it as bytes gave 0% surveyed; fixed after reading the GridServer docs).
- Overpass returned HTTP 406 without a User-Agent. It is reachable from Go; some sandboxed tools had no network.
- LibreTerrain: not found on the public web, but later found installed locally in ../LibreTerrain; see ecosystem.md §1.
- Falmouth: OSM coastline is a median 101 m from the DEM shoreline (p90 268 m). Mindelo: 142 m / 331 m. The DEM is 39–58 m resolution and includes a tidal range, so this is expected order of magnitude, but not yet separated into datum vs. horizontal causes.

Known problems: see [roadmap](roadmap.md).

## 2026-10-30 (later): review fixes

- Validator no longer says "upsampled" when the output cell is coarser than the source; split into `upsampled` (cell < delivered source cell) and `gebco-fill` (share of water cells without survey data, computed from the mask).
- Verified GMRT terms (CC BY 4.0, citation required, **not for navigation**) and added GEBCO credit; ATTRIBUTION.txt and README updated. Cached provenance now takes licence text from code, not from stale sidecars.
- Manifest carries `checkpoints` (highest, lowest, four corners). Unity importer converts them to Unity space independently and fails the import on >5 cm error. Falmouth: max error 3 mm. A north/south or east/west flip would have passed the first version of the importer.
- Importer: shader fallback, translucent sea, in-engine screenshot (`docs/img/falmouth-unity.png`).
- Manifest no longer contains local absolute paths.
- Local git history re-authored to the configured user identity.

## 2026-10-30: project moved to Tools/OceanBuilder

Repo moved to `GameDev/Tools/OceanBuilder` next to `Tools/LibreTerrain`. Git history intact, `go vet` and `go test ./...` pass from the new location (no absolute paths in the repo).

## 2026-10-30 (session 3): LibreTerrain round trip

Ran LibreTerrain's headless MCP bridge and measured it (`docs/research/libreterrain.md`). Built `ocean libreterrain export|run|inspect|import` and a `refinement` edit layer in `ocean build` (ADR 0003).

- Falmouth 513², EXR32, unedited: max |error| 0 m, 6/6 checkpoints exact, 16/16 tiles byte-identical after rebuild.
- Real edit (LibreTerrain `adjust.blur`) on a non-square fixture: land edited, 83 water edits ignored, shoreline cells unchanged, validator clean.
- Findings that shaped the design: LibreTerrain is vertex-registered like us; non-square worlds are stretched (so we pad to a square); EXR is unclipped metres, PNG16 clips; project files are MessagePack (we let LibreTerrain write them through the bridge); a build larger than the project resolution silently never runs.
- Gotcha: cached provenance stores relative file paths, so `ocean build` must run from the directory that holds `.ocean-cache` (not fixed yet).
